- 👋 Hi, I’m @RayanJunaid
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Engineering as a future career, or something of the sort, and I think coding and maths is fun.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to program in Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any fun projects but I'm still in the learning stage so I probably wont collaborate till later.
- 📫 How to reach me: N/A for now.
